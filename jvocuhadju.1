.SH NAME
jvocuhadju \- Lujvo picker (based on the rules in the reference grammar.)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B jvocuhadju
[-v] [-a] [-l] [-R] [-S] [-A] [-q]
.I tanru-component-1
[
.BR "" ...
.I tanru-component-n

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I jvocuhadju
is a program that reads a list of tanru-components (gismu or cmavo) on
the command line, and constructs the possible short-form lujvo
corresponding to those components in sequence.  The possible lujvo are
displayed ranked in order of desirability, with their scores shown
based on the algorithm in the reference grammar.  The lowest score is
best.
.PP
Where a tanru-component is a cmavo containing an apostrophe, the apostrophe may
be replaced by the letter "h" on the command line.  This is a convenience to
avoid having to backslash-escape the apostrophe to hide it from the shell.
